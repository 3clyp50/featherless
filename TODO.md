# TODO.md — Featherless (Native Visit Workflow)

**Spec:** `PLAN.md`, `HERO_PATIENT.md`, `CITATIONS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`.
**Submission:** Mon 2026-05-11, 18:00 Europe/Rome.
**Today:** Sun 2026-05-10 (D5).
**Repo:** https://github.com/TerminallyLazy/featherless · **Authors (in order):** Chadwick, Alessandro Frau.
**Operating rule:** if a task isn't on this list and isn't blocking submission, it goes to `BACKLOG.md`. No exceptions until after submit.

## 🤝 Delegation protocol (read this first if you are a subagent)

Every block below is a **scope**, owned by one subagent. PLAN.md §11 has the full contract. The short version:

1. **Read your scope row in PLAN §11.** Do not start work until you have read your `Writable`, `Read-only context`, and `Acceptance` columns.
2. **Create `agents/<scope>/TODO.md`** at start. Copy the relevant lines from this file verbatim under `## Mirrored tasks`. Update statuses there *as you work*, not at the end. This file survives any context compaction.
3. **Touch only files in your `Writable` list.** Anything else → judge rejects the scope.
4. **Log decisions in your mirror TODO.** Any non-obvious choice (a schema field name, a retry count, a fallback path) goes under `## Decisions log` with one-line rationale. Future-you will thank present-you.
5. **Surface contract questions, don't guess.** If `HERO_PATIENT.md` §7 contradicts PLAN §4, raise it in `## Open contract questions` and tag it `block` or `non-block`. The judge or the human resolves; you do not invent.
6. **Output contract:** at end, your final message is (a) files created/modified, (b) one paragraph of decisions made, (c) any open questions. No "I have successfully completed…" prose.

The **judge subagent** merges, runs `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`, and rejects anything that drifted from the contract. Acceptance gates are mechanical, not editorial.

**Mirror-TODO file path convention:** `agents/<scope>/TODO.md` — committed to the repo, visible to human judges as a multi-agent provenance artifact. (`agents/` is a feature, not noise. Tripathi sees it.)

## 🚦 Stage One — non-scoring gates (must all be green by D6 lunch)

These are pass/fail. If any one is red at submit time, we don't get judged.

- [ ] **PO Marketplace publication** — featherless MCP URL added under `Configuration → MCP Servers`; orchestrator agent-card URL added under `Agents → External Agents`; both visible in launchpad and invokable; configured project published to the Prompt Opinion Marketplace; Marketplace URL copied for Devpost. See [`docs/publish-readiness.md`](docs/publish-readiness.md).
- [ ] **Platform integration** — orchestrator consultable *from inside* a PO BYO Agent via "Consult with another agent" (not just curl-able at the edge URL)
- [ ] **Protocol adherence** — MCP server (JSON-RPC over Streamable HTTP, `initialize` declares `ai.promptopinion/fhir-context` extension) + A2A agent (agent card + `message/send`, declares the `https://app.promptopinion.ai/schemas/a2a/v1/fhir-context` extension)
- [ ] **SHARP context** — `X-FHIR-Server-URL` / `X-FHIR-Access-Token` / `X-Patient-ID` flow proven in logs end-to-end (orchestrator A2A metadata → featherless headers → FHIR); **zero token storage** — verified by inspecting Worker source
- [ ] **Synthetic data only** — local HAPI Docker + hand-crafted Mrs. García bundle; no PHI

## 🗓️ D5 — Sun May 10 (today)

**Theme:** Land the Featherless visit workflow. Ship locally. README skeleton.

### Block 1 · Morning (4h) — substrate + first tool

**Scopes:** ~~`S-po-manifest-spike`~~ (DONE) · `S-hero-bundle` · `S-tool1-visit-context-packer`

- [x] ~~**00:00** [`S-po-manifest-spike`] PO manifest verification.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-05-10** — PO accepts external A2A agents via agent-card URL, MCP servers via `initialize` extension. No `marketplace.yaml`. Two-Worker A2A confirmed. See [`agents/S-po-manifest-spike/DECISION.md`](agents/S-po-manifest-spike/DECISION.md).
- [x] ~~**00:30** [`S-hero-bundle`] Hand-craft `scripts/hero-bundle.json`~~ **DONE** — 25-entry transaction bundle (1 Patient, 5 Conditions, 6 MedicationRequests, 1 Encounter, 3 ServiceRequests, 1 Appointment, 7 Observations, 1 DocumentReference). IDs match §7. `request.method=PUT` per entry → idempotent.
- [x] ~~**01:00** [`S-hero-bundle`] `scripts/load-hero.ts`~~ **DONE** — tsx-runnable loader. Smoke-tested 2026-05-10 against HAPI 8.8.0: HTTP 200, 25/25 entries OK, Patient + 8 verification queries green. `clinical_get_context` smoke deferred to `S-tool1-visit-context-packer` (which boots the Worker anyway). See [`agents/S-hero-bundle/TODO.md`](agents/S-hero-bundle/TODO.md) for full closing notes.
- [x] ~~**02:00** [`S-tool1-visit-context-packer`] Build **`src/tools/clinical-visit-context.ts`**~~ **DONE** — native Featherless `clinical_pack_visit_context` tool registered from `src/tools/clinical-visit-context.ts`; schema in `src/tools/schemas/visit-context.ts`; product-specific legacy namespace scrubbed from code/docs.
- [x] ~~**03:00** [`S-tool1-visit-context-packer`] Vitest unit test against the loaded hero bundle.~~ **DONE** — `test/tools/clinical-visit-context.test.ts` proves the §7 envelope, furosemide `action="new"`, 5 active problems, 4 orders, local HAPI headers, and missing-header error envelope.
- [ ] **03:45** [judge] Merge S-hero-bundle + S-tool1 into main; run typecheck + lint + tests; tag `d5-tool1-green`.

### Block 2 · Afternoon (4h) — tools 2 + 3

**Scopes:** `S-tool2-patient-packet` · `S-tool3-care-team-closure` (can run in parallel — different writable surfaces, no shared state)

- [ ] **04:00** [human only] verify the Cloudflare Workers AI binding and `LLM_MODEL` in `wrangler.jsonc`. No external LLM provider secret is used.
- [x] ~~**04:15** [`S-tool2-patient-packet`] Build **`src/tools/clinical-patient-packet.ts`**~~ **DONE** — `clinical_generate_patient_packet` uses Workers AI via the Worker `AI` binding, returns packet markdown + structured content, and avoids external LLM provider keys.
- [x] ~~**05:30** [`S-tool2-patient-packet`] Reading-level metrics inline~~ **DONE** — `src/tools/readability.ts` reports Flesch-Kincaid and INFLESZ; unit tests cover English and Spanish targets.
- [x] ~~**06:00** [`S-tool2-patient-packet`] Citation-grounding validator~~ **DONE** — validator checks allowed citations, unsupported quoted phrases, and unknown dose strings; tests cover passing packet generation and tampered rejection.
- [x] ~~**06:30** [`S-tool3-care-team-closure`] Build **`src/tools/clinical-care-team-closure.ts`**~~ **DONE** — emits 3 `Task` + 1 `CommunicationRequest` + 1 `DocumentReference` from visit context; R4-validates via FHIR `$validate`; `WRITE_BACK=1` is required for caller-requested PUT write-back and defaults off. Registered tool: `clinical_prepare_care_team_closure`.
- [x] ~~**07:30** [`S-tool3-care-team-closure`] Vitest unit tests for tool 3~~ **DONE** — validates JSON shape, statuses, `intent`, `for.reference` chaining, local HAPI validation, and missing-SHARP-header handling.
- [x] ~~**07:45** [judge] Merge S-tool2 + S-tool3; run typecheck + lint + tests; tag `d5-tools-green`~~ **DONE** — three native Featherless visit-workflow tools are registered, locally green, and validated against the hero HAPI path.

### Block 3 · Evening (4h) — orchestrator + e2e + PO publish + README

**Scopes:** `S-orchestrator` · `S-po-publish-and-readme`

- [x] ~~**08:00** [`S-orchestrator`] Scaffold `orchestrator/`~~ **DONE** — separate `wrangler-orchestrator.jsonc`, native Worker `orchestrator/src/index.ts`, public AgentCard route, and JSON-RPC `message/send` dispatcher. No `@a2a-js/sdk`, Express, Hono, or extra router dependency.
- [x] ~~**09:00** [`S-orchestrator`] SHARP header forwarding test~~ **DONE** — Vitest asserts A2A FHIR metadata becomes `X-FHIR-Server-URL`, `X-FHIR-Access-Token`, and `X-Patient-ID` on outgoing MCP calls; response payloads never return the token; AgentCard fields match the local Prompt Opinion SDK reference.
- [x] ~~**09:30** [judge] orchestrator trace test~~ **DONE** — mocked MCP e2e-style test proves the three-tool sequence (`clinical_pack_visit_context` → `clinical_generate_patient_packet` → `clinical_prepare_care_team_closure`) and non-zero trace timings. Substrate HAPI path remains covered by `npm test`; deployed PO registration remains in the D6 gate.
- [x] ~~**10:00** [`S-po-publish-and-readme`] Migrate docs into this folder~~ **DONE** — `HERO_PATIENT.md`, `CITATIONS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, and `LICENSE` now live in `featherless/` and reflect the current TypeScript / Workers AI architecture.
- [x] ~~**10:15** [`S-po-publish-and-readme`] Write `docs/po-registration.md`~~ **DONE** — judge-facing steps cover the MCP URL, A2A AgentCard URL, FHIR context extension, expected tools, screenshots, and troubleshooting.
- [x] ~~**10:30** [`S-po-publish-and-readme`] README skeleton at 80%~~ **DONE** — README has the hackathon table, sourced stats, tools table, orchestrator section, hero patient, AI Factor, architecture, 5Ts, standards, timeline, MIT license, and authors. No `marketplace.yaml`.
- [x] ~~**10:45** [`S-po-publish-and-readme`] Prompt Opinion publish-readiness findings~~ **DONE** — `docs/publish-readiness.md` records official Stage One/video/Marketplace requirements, fixed deploy blockers, remaining human/platform gates, and exact Devpost inputs.
- [ ] **11:30** **Submit Devpost as draft tonight** — placeholder video link OK, everything else final-shape.
- [ ] **11:45** `git tag d5-eod-green`. Sleep.

### D5 EOD gate (must be true before sleep)

- [x] Three Featherless visit-workflow tools work independently against the loaded hero patient
- [x] Orchestrator contract test runs end-to-end with full trace
- [ ] Both URLs (featherless `/mcp`, orchestrator `/.well-known/agent-card.json`) register cleanly in a fresh PO workspace — **blocked locally:** `npx wrangler whoami` reports not authenticated; both Workers pass `wrangler deploy --dry-run`.
- [ ] Devpost draft submitted
- [x] README at 80%

If any of these is red → record an *insurance* rough-cut video tonight even if hideous. Same rule as the original D3 plan.

## 🗓️ D6 — Mon May 11 (submission day)

**Theme:** Record. Polish. Submit by 18:00. No new code after 14:00.

### Block 1 · Morning (4h) — deploy, publish, record

- [x] **00:00** Authenticate Cloudflare (`npx wrangler login` or API token) and confirm `npx wrangler whoami` against `Inf3ctious007@gmail.com's Account` (`2a6a96ae8f3d1a965febebb24df965f4`).
- [x] **00:15** Deploy the MCP Worker (`npm run deploy`). Confirm `https://featherless-mcp.inf3ctious007.workers.dev/mcp` is public and Workers AI is bound.
- [x] **00:30** Deploy the orchestrator Worker (`npm run deploy:orchestrator`). Confirm `https://featherless-orchestrator.inf3ctious007.workers.dev/.well-known/agent-card.json` is public and the `FEATHERLESS_MCP -> featherless-mcp` service binding reaches the MCP Worker.
- [x] **00:40** Configure Prompt Opinion MCP server: endpoint `https://featherless-mcp.inf3ctious007.workers.dev/mcp`, `Streamable HTTP`, `No Authentication (Open)`, Prompt Opinion FHIR extension enabled, `Selective Permissions`.
  - Active scopes: `patient/Patient.rs`, `patient/AllergyIntolerance.rs`, `patient/Appointment.rs`, `patient/Condition.rs`, `patient/Coverage.rs`, `patient/DiagnosticReport.rs`, `patient/DocumentReference.rs`, `patient/Encounter.rs`, `patient/Immunization.rs`, `patient/MedicationRequest.rs`, `patient/MedicationStatement.rs`, `patient/Observation.rs`, `patient/Procedure.rs`.
- [ ] **00:45** Make the synthetic Mrs. García FHIR server reachable from deployed Workers. Either use a Prompt Opinion workspace FHIR context that can host the bundle, or load `scripts/hero-bundle.json` into a temporary HTTPS synthetic HAPI instance with `FHIR_SERVER_URL=https://<synthetic-fhir-host>/fhir npx tsx scripts/load-hero.ts`.
- [ ] **01:00** Register the A2A external agent in PO per `docs/po-registration.md`. AgentCard URL is `https://featherless-orchestrator.inf3ctious007.workers.dev/.well-known/agent-card.json`. Enable its FHIR context extension if prompted, then screenshot the workspace listing (MCP servers + External Agents pages) to `docs/sharp-proof/02-po-listing.png`.
- [ ] **01:20** Run end-to-end through PO workspace once. Screenshot the deployed SHARP headers to `docs/sharp-proof/01-network-tab.png` and the orchestrator trace pane to `docs/sharp-proof/03-trace.png`. **This is the only run where it matters that it works in PO; if PO integration breaks here, fall back to local-Worker demo and document it in README under "Limitations."**
- [ ] **01:40** Publish the configured project to the Prompt Opinion Marketplace and copy the Marketplace URL. Record the MCP URL, AgentCard URL, and PO invocation proof regardless. If the publish UI is not visible after workspace registration, ask PO support/Discord immediately with those artifacts; if there is no response within 15 minutes, proceed with the video using workspace registration proof, mark Marketplace publication as "pending platform support" in README limitations, and still copy the Marketplace URL if it appears later.
- [ ] **02:00** Record final 2:45–2:55 video to the hackathon beat list. Two takes max. Pick the better one.
  - 0:00–0:15 patient hook (Mrs. García leaving the cardiologist)
  - 0:15–0:35 three statistics on screen, sourced from CITATIONS
  - 0:35–1:30 PO platform run — agent handshake, A2A trace pane, tools fire
  - 1:30–2:15 the artifact: Spanish, grade-6, furosemide PRN flagged, FK + INFLESZ scores visible, FHIR Tasks, citations
  - 2:15–2:35 standards proof: SHARP headers in network tab · PO workspace listing (MCP servers + External Agents) · multi-agent trace
  - 2:35–2:50 close card: authors (Chadwick, Alessandro Frau) + GitHub URL + PO registration URLs
- [ ] **03:00** Upload to YouTube *unlisted*. Test the link in an incognito window.
- [ ] **03:30** Record judge walkthrough Loom, 5–7 min: SHARP middleware, A2A trace, tool surfaces, citation pack, productization.

### Block 2 · Lunch (1h) — outsider tests

- [ ] **04:00** **Cold-watch test:** one non-team person watches the 3-min video with no context. If they can't say what it does by 0:30, re-edit the hook only.
- [ ] **04:30** **Judge-walk test:** different non-team person opens Devpost → README → `docs/po-registration.md` → registers both URLs in their own PO workspace → invokes the agent. Time it.

### Block 3 · Afternoon (3h) — finalize + submit

- [ ] **05:00** Fix exactly **one** thing from each test. Resist the urge to fix more.
- [ ] **05:30** README at 100%. Both video links embedded. License + citations + decisions + backlog all in place at repo root.
- [ ] **06:00** Update Devpost with real video link. Re-read submission once. Check video plays from cold link.
- [ ] **06:30** **Submit final.** Do not submit at 02:55 UTC tomorrow. Submit by 18:00 Europe/Rome today.
- [ ] **07:00** Post-submit: tweet, share to PO community, send to the named hackathon contacts.

### D6 EOD gate

- ✅ Submitted, confirmed in Devpost
- ✅ Video plays from cold link in incognito
- ✅ Both URLs invokable in a judge's own PO workspace per `docs/po-registration.md`
- ✅ All 3 sharp-proof screenshots committed

---

## 🛡️ Standing rules (apply to every minute of D5 + D6)

- [ ] **Three Featherless visit-workflow tools max.** New ideas → `BACKLOG.md`.
- [ ] **Citation-or-cut.** Any clinical claim, anywhere, must trace to `CITATIONS.md`. No grounding → cut.
- [ ] **No token storage, ever.** Both Workers log per-request; persist nothing. Verify by reading the source before deploy.
- [ ] **Synthetic data only.** Local HAPI + hand-crafted bundle. If HAPI is exposed for judging, it must contain only the synthetic bundle and must be temporary or access-controlled.
- [ ] **Human-in-the-loop on send.** `CommunicationRequest.status = "draft"` with `intent = "proposal"`, never `"active"`.
- [ ] **Build like deadline is D6 14:00.** The 4 hours after that are submission, not building.
- [ ] **No new dependencies after D5 EOD.** Period.

---

## 🚨 Fallback ladder (if D5 slips)

Only one of these can be true. Pick the lowest-risk path that's still green at the time of decision.

- **If by D5 18:00 local** the orchestrator isn't routing SHARP headers correctly → collapse to single-Worker `/orchestrate` route in featherless. Update PLAN §3 + S3 sentence. Lose ~10% of Tripathi's claim, gain 4h.
- **If by D5 22:00 local** Workers AI output is flaky → switch to template-first Spanish packet generation with Workers AI only for final wording polish; English becomes the control path. Document any limitation in BACKLOG.
- **If by D5 EOD** any of {patient packet generates, hero bundle loads, both URLs register in PO} is red → ship the *substrate* + a single demo tool + a manual demo script. Reframe as "Featherless v0.1 — substrate shipped, visit workflow partial, orchestrator in BACKLOG." This is the worst-case but still a real submission.
- **Never** attempt a fourth tool, a second hero patient, or a v2 architecture after D5 12:00. Ship what works.

## 💡 Pinned reminder

> Honorable mention: **$1,000**. Grand prize: **$7,500**.
> The delta is the README, the PO workspace listing (judge can paste two URLs and it works), and the video.
> **Spend D6 morning on those, not on code.**
